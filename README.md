# Monkey Lang Interpreter in uiua.....

Am I really going to attempt to do this???

I honestly am not sure. I think I know how to do this in theory.
I know how Aaron Hsu's thesis works.
I know how to use uiua pretty well.
This should be totally doable...

That said, it will probably be a big pain.
No local variables...
Using an array language for tree stuff...
Needing to plot out how parsing works...
Needing a tree walking interpreter in an array language (made one for [bf in bqn before](https://github.com/bhansconnect/monkey-bqn))...
Like I know this can all be done and know how the subpieces work, but putting it all together would be a pain probably.

All of the function scoping, local variables, and dictionaries will be more complicated.


This all said, I am try it...idk....to be seen.
